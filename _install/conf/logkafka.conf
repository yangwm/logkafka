############################# Logkafka Basics #############################

# The connection string for the zookeeper connection in the form 
#
#  -|-----------------------------------------------------|-
#   |   host1:port1,host2:port2,host3:port3/chroot/path   |
#  -|-----------------------------------------------------|-
#
# The "/chroot/path" of connection string *MUST* be the same as of the kafka server.
# Multiple hosts can be given to allow fail-over. All data of logkafka will be 
# stored at znodes in "/chroot/path/logkafka".
#
# Example:
# zookeeper.connect = "host1:port1,host2:port2,host3:port3/chroot/path"

zookeeper.connect = "127.0.0.1:2181"

# Position saving file, using relative path or absolute path.
#
# 1. Relative path: relative to the dir of this file.
# 2. Absolute path
#
# Examples:
# pos.path = ../data/pos.ClusterName.ChrootPath # relative path
# pos.path = /tmp/data/pos.ClusterName.ChrootPath # absolute path

pos.path = ../data/pos.test

# If you want to run multiple logkafka processes with the same zookeeper,
# you must set diffrent logkafka ids, the default id is the hostname.
# 
# You can set the value to an environment variable
# Example:
# logkafka.id = ${ENV_VAR}
